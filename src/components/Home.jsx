          <strong>Three 15 minute presentations</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Each meeting will start with three lightning talks about front-end
          development and design, which should range from 5 to 15 minutes
          each. Want to talk about Backbone.js? Got some tips on Angular?
          Opinionated on OOCSS? Looking for design critiques from experienced
          professionals? We want to see you present!{' '}

          <strong>Discuss & Network</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          After our presentations, weâ€™ll open the room up to general
          conversation so folks can network with both the speakers and each
          other. One of our main goals for this meetup is help introduce
          developers to each other and possibly share ideas / solutions to
          common front-end development problems.
