          learn the latest HTML5 / CSS3 / Javascript tricks and hacks?
        </p>

          Are you a designer who would love a second set of eyes on their
          latest work, or to talk about the newest design trends and styles?

          <strong>Three 5-15 minute presentations</strong>

        <p>
          Each meeting will start with three lightning talks about front-end
          development and design, which should range from 5 to 15 minutes
          each.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Got some tips on React or Angular?

              Have opinions on Tailwind?

          <strong>Discuss & Network</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          After our presentations, weâ€™ll open the room up to general
          conversation so folks can network with both the speakers and each
          other. One of our main goals for this meetup is help introduce
          developers to each other and possibly share ideas / solutions to
          common front-end development problems and strengthen our local Dev community!
