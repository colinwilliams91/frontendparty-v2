          learn the latest HTML5 / CSS3 / Javascript tricks and hacks?

          <strong>Discuss & Network</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          After our presentations, weâ€™ll open the room up to general
          conversation so folks can network with both the speakers and each
          other. One of our main goals for this meetup is help introduce
          developers to each other and possibly share ideas / solutions to
          common front-end development problems.
