# Front End Party website

## Setup

```sh
git clone git@github.com:frontEndParty/frontendparty-v2.git
cd front-end-party
yarn
yarn start
```

## Develop

Styles are written in Sass, compiled using Compass. If you have Compass installed you can compile Sass by running `yarn style` from the root directory.

## Deploy

The website is deployed on Heroku. All you should need to do is:

* set a `heroku` git remote
* run `yarn deploy`

Ask the other organizers if you need the heroku remote.
