## Preparation

- Ideally, reach out at least two weeks to someone you want to give a talk
- [Link to website repo](https://github.com/frontEndParty/frontendparty-v2)
- Try to manually post event announcements early (a week out), in addition to the automatic Meetup.com announcements

## Presentations

- 5-15 minutes
- For Zoom, shared screens
- (Ace) Podium setup for speakers, presentation/screen (have some different cables handy!)

## Meetup

1. Get there early
2. Greet folks
3. Already have machine setup to show the website, as an "intro"
4. Get an idea of when the speakers want to go (order)

## Talks

1. Encourage speakers to have (when applicable) repos
2. (Post-Meetup) If possible, share recordings
